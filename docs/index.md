## 🚀 Introduction

**TradingView Scraper** is a robust Python library designed to bridge the gap between TradingView's visual data and your algorithmic needs. Whether you are building a trading bot, a market analysis dashboard, or a research tool, this library allows you to extract real-time and historical data directly from TradingView without the need for an official API key.

It goes beyond simple price scraping, offering deep access to:
- **Technical Analysis**: 80+ built-in indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.) calculated in real-time.
- **Social Sentiment**: Community Ideas, Minds discussions, and News sentiment.
- **Fundamental Data**: Financial statements, ratios, and company overview.
- **Live Streaming**: WebSocket integration for real-time OHLCV and indicator updates.

## ⚡ Quick Glance

Get up and running in seconds. Here's how to fetch technical indicators for Bitcoin:

```python

# Initialize the scraper
scraper = Indicators()

# Get RSI and MACD for BTCUSD on Binance
data = scraper.scrape(
    exchange="BINANCE",
    symbol="BTCUSD",
    timeframe="1d",
    indicators=["RSI", "MACD"]
)

print(data)
```
