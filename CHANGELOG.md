## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-15

### Overview
Major release introducing the new `tv_scraper` package — a complete architectural refactor with modular design, standardized APIs, and comprehensive test coverage.

### Added
- **New `tv_scraper` package** with clean modular architecture alongside the legacy `tradingview_scraper` package
- **11 scraper modules** organized into four categories:
  - Market Data: `Technicals`, `Overview`, `Fundamentals`, `Markets`
  - Social: `Ideas`, `Minds`, `News`
  - Screening: `Screener`, `MarketMovers`, `SymbolMarkets`
  - Events: `Calendar`
- **Streaming module** with `Streamer` (OHLC + indicators) and `RealTimeData` (simple OHLCV/watchlist)
- **`BaseScraper` base class** providing standardized response envelopes, HTTP handling, and export logic
- **`DataValidator` singleton** for exchange, indicator, timeframe, and field validation with suggestions
- **Standardized response envelope** (`status`, `data`, `metadata`, `error`) across all scrapers
- **Core exception hierarchy**: `TvScraperError`, `ValidationError`, `DataNotFoundError`, `NetworkError`, `ExportError`
- **Top-level re-exports** — all public classes importable directly from `tv_scraper`
- **238+ unit tests** covering all modules with full mocking (no network calls)
- **95 integration tests** for import smoke testing and cross-module verification
- **Comprehensive documentation** with migration guide, API conventions, and per-module docs

### Changed
- **API naming conventions**: consistent `get_*` method names (e.g., `get_technicals`, `get_ideas`, `get_news`)
- **Parameter splitting**: exchange and symbol are always separate parameters
- **Error handling**: scrapers return error envelopes instead of raising exceptions
- **Export validation**: invalid `export_type` raises `ValueError` at construction time

### Migration
See `docs_new/migration-guide.md` for the complete migration guide from `tradingview_scraper` to `tv_scraper`.

## [0.5.2] - 2025-12-18

### Overview
This release reintroduces pagination support for the Minds discussions scraper to handle large data requests and improves export functionality reliability.

### Added
- **Pagination Support**: Re-added pagination to `Minds.get_minds()` method to fetch multiple pages of discussions when needed, allowing retrieval of more than the first page's worth of data
- **Cursor-Based Navigation**: Implemented cursor-based pagination using TradingView's API `next` parameter for efficient data fetching

### Changed
- **Minds API**: Modified `get_minds()` to support fetching multiple pages until the requested limit is reached or no more data is available
- **Export Handling**: Moved pandas import inside `save_csv_file()` function for lazy loading, preventing import errors when CSV export is not used

### Fixed
- **Large Limit Handling**: Resolved issues with large limit parameters by implementing proper pagination instead of limiting to first page only
- **Import Errors**: Fixed pandas-related import failures by deferring import until CSV export is actually needed

## [0.5.1] - 2025-12-13

### Overview
This release focuses on simplifying the Minds community discussions scraper by removing pagination and improving packaging for cleaner builds.

### Changed
- **Minds API Refactor**: Simplified `Minds.get_minds()` to fetch only the first page of discussions (removed pagination logic for better reliability and performance)
- **API Simplification**: Removed `sort` parameter and `get_all_minds()` method from Minds scraper
- **Build Backend**: Switched from setuptools to hatchling for modern packaging
- **Build Configuration**: Cleaned up `pyproject.toml` by removing setuptools-specific configuration sections and removed obsolete `MANIFEST.in`
- **Package Exclusions**: Ensured clean builds by relying on `.gitignore` for excluding unwanted files (`.vscode`, `__pycache__`, `dist`, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Removed `setuptools` from runtime dependencies in `setup.py`
- **Documentation**: Updated MkDocs configuration to use proper icon syntax and cleaned up social links
- **Tests**: Streamlined test suite by removing pagination-related tests and sort validation

### Fixed
- **Packaging**: Ensured clean package builds by properly excluding development and cache files
