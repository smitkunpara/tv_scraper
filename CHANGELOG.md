# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### ✨ API Standardization & Strict Typing
This major update standardizes the public API across all scrapers with descriptive, discoverable method names (e.g., `get_news()`, `get_minds()`) and enforces strict type safety by requiring separate `exchange` and `symbol` parameters.

### Added
- **Full Type Hinting**: 100% type hint coverage across all modules, satisfying `mypy` strict mode.
- **Strict Generic Types**: Added explicit type parameters to all `dict` and `list` annotations in streaming modules.

### Changed
- **API Standardization**: Standardized primary scraping methods with descriptive names (e.g., `get_technicals()`, `get_fundamentals()`, `get_minds()`, `get_news_headlines()`) across all scraper classes to replace generic `get_data()` or `scrape()` methods.
- **Strict Parameter Passing**: Removed legacy `EXCHANGE:SYMBOL` string parsing. All methods now require `exchange` and `symbol` as distinct, validated parameters.
- **Streaming Refactor**: Substantially cleaned up `RealTimeData` and `Streamer` logic with improved connection handling and type safety.
- **Standardized Response Metadata**: Metadata now consistently returns separate `exchange` and `symbol` keys.

### Fixed
- **Docstring Stubs**: Updated all class-level examples and method documentation to reflect the new API naming conventions.
- **Redundant Logic**: Eliminated duplicate parsing and validation logic in core and streaming layers.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-19

### ✨ Unified Validation & Options Stability
This release centralizes all symbol, exchange, and indicator validation into a single core component, eliminating redundancy across the library. It also significantly improves the stability of the Options scraper by adding browser-standard headers to prevent API blocks and fixing result sanitization.

### Added
- **Unified Validation System**: Core `DataValidator.verify_symbol_exchange()` and `verify_options_symbol()` methods for reliable cross-module validation.
- **Browser-Standard Headers**: Standardized HTTP headers for Options searching to ensure 100% success rate and avoid 403 Forbidden errors.

### Changed
- **Validator Migration**: Moved `validate_symbols` out of `streaming.utils` and into `core.validators` to serve as a library-wide singleton.
- **Improved Result Parsing**: Added HTML tag stripping (e.g., `<em>`) for cleaner option search results.
- **Refactored Scrapers**: Updated all scrapers (Technicals, Fundamentals, Overview, etc.) to use the unified validation layer for better performance and consistency.

### Fixed
- **Options Search Block**: Resolved issue where searching for options would return 403 Forbidden on certain environments.
- **Redundant Streaming Code**: Removed duplicate validation logic from `streaming/utils.py`.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-16

### 🚀 Initial Production Release
This version transforms the library into a high-performance, industry-standard tool for TradingView data extraction. It introduces a complete architectural refactor with modular design, standardized APIs, comprehensive test coverage, and optimized WebSocket streaming.

- **New `tv_scraper` package** with clean modular architecture alongside the legacy `tradingview_scraper` package
- **`Options` scraper** — Fetch option chains by expiration or strike price via TradingView's options scanner API
- **WebSocket Performance Optimizations** — Low-latency streaming with TCP_NODELAY socket option and configurable timeout to prevent indefinite hangs
- **Dual Session Subscription** — Real-time price streaming subscribes to both quote session (QSD) and chart session (DU) for maximum update frequency (~1 update per 3-4 seconds)
- **Enhanced Message Processing** — Added support for DU (data update) messages in addition to QSD messages for faster price updates
- **Comprehensive Live API Tests** — Added `tests/live_api/test_streaming.py` with extensive real-world streaming tests covering multiple timeframes, exchanges, asset types, update frequency verification, connection stability, and edge cases
- **Unit Tests for WebSocket Optimizations** — Added detailed tests for TCP_NODELAY, dual session subscription, mixed message handling, and socket timeout handling
- **Live API smoke tests** — New `tests/live_api/` directory for verifying real-time endpoint availability
- **`Streamer.get_available_indicators()`** — fetch standard built-in indicator IDs and versions for candle streaming
- **12 scraper modules** organized into four categories:
  - Market Data: `Technicals`, `Overview`, `Fundamentals`, `Markets`, `Options`
  - Social: `Ideas`, `Minds`, `News`
  - Screening: `Screener`, `MarketMovers`, `SymbolMarkets`
  - Events: `Calendar`
- **Streaming module** with `Streamer` (OHLC + indicators) and `RealTimeData` (simple OHLCV/watchlist)
- **`BaseScraper` base class** providing standardized response envelopes, HTTP handling, and export logic
- **`DataValidator` singleton** for exchange, indicator, timeframe, and field validation with suggestions
- **Standardized response envelope** (`status`, `data`, `metadata`, `error`) across all scrapers
- **Core exception hierarchy**: `TvScraperError`, `ValidationError`, `DataNotFoundError`, `NetworkError`, `ExportError`
- **Top-level re-exports** — all public classes importable directly from `tv_scraper`
- **265+ unit tests** covering all modules with full mocking (no network calls)
- **50+ live API tests** for comprehensive connectivity verification and streaming performance testing
- **Live connectivity verification tests** for import smoke testing and cross-module verification
- **Comprehensive documentation** with migration guide, API conventions, and per-module docs

### Changed
- **Modern Tooling** — Replaced `flake8` and `pylint` with `Ruff` (10-100x faster) and strict `Mypy` type checking
- **StreamHandler** — Added TCP_NODELAY socket option during WebSocket connection creation to disable Nagle's algorithm for lower latency
- **StreamHandler Reliability** — Added `timeout=10` and `enable_multithread=True` to WebSocket connections to prevent indefinite hangs on half-open connections
- **User-Agent Documentation** — Added explicit comments about keeping User-Agent headers updated to avoid potential blocks
- **Streamer.stream_realtime_price()** — Now subscribes to both quote and chart sessions, processes both QSD and DU message types
- **Socket Timeout Handling** — Added graceful handling of socket.timeout exceptions in streaming generators
- **Unified Parameter Handling** — Standardized `EXCHANGE:SYMBOL` parsing across all core scrapers (`Ideas`, `News`, `Technicals`, `Fundamentals`, `Overview`)
- **API naming conventions**: consistent `get_*` method names (e.g., `get_technicals`, `get_ideas`, `get_news`)
- **Parameter splitting**: exchange and symbol are always separate parameters
- **Error handling**: scrapers return error envelopes instead of raising exceptions
- **Export validation**: invalid `export_type` raises `ValueError` at construction time
- **Cleaned Codebase** — Removed legacy backward compatibility logic for cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Code Formatting** — All source files formatted with Ruff, fixing 258 linting violations for consistent code style

### Performance Improvements
- **WebSocket Update Frequency**: Increased from ~1 update per 15 seconds to ~1 update per 3-4 seconds, matching browser performance
- **Reduced Latency**: TCP_NODELAY eliminates packet transmission delays
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Better handling of network timeouts and connection stability
- **Dual Session Data**: Combines quote and chart session updates for comprehensive real-time market data

### Technical Details
- TCP_NODELAY applied via `sockopt` parameter: `[(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1)]`
- Chart session uses 1-second timeframe for real-time OHLCV updates
- DU messages extract close price and volume from OHLCV arrays: `[timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume]`
- QSD messages provide quote-level data with bid/ask spreads, volume, and percentage changes

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/streaming/index.md` with performance optimization overview
- Updated `docs/streaming/streamer.md` with WebSocket optimization details and dual session strategy
- Updated `docs/streaming/realtime-price.md` with performance notes

## [0.5.2] - 2025-12-18

### Overview
This release reintroduces pagination support for the Minds discussions scraper to handle large data requests and improves export functionality reliability.

### Added
- **Pagination Support**: Re-added pagination to `Minds.get_minds()` method to fetch multiple pages of discussions when needed, allowing retrieval of more than the first page's worth of data
- **Cursor-Based Navigation**: Implemented cursor-based pagination using TradingView's API `next` parameter for efficient data fetching

### Changed
- **Minds API**: Modified `get_minds()` to support fetching multiple pages until the requested limit is reached or no more data is available
